why I like glamor
---

facts 

- lets you write real css
- it's synchronous, yet fast. 
- supports all of css.
- has escape hatches and js fallbacks for the trickier bits. 
- use a rule as a dom prop, or as a classname. both work. 
- it hits all the points in [Ryan's Random Thoughts on Inline Styles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkPcGS4TzdQ)
- framework independent, yet has goodies for your f/w of choice 
- [todo] tooling support 

opinions

- very little boilerplate. beyond importing the module and required functions, none at all, really. 
- it actively steals the best ideas from every other css-in-js libs
- by treating css as 'values', composition is easier *and* simpler
- all the goodies are in the same module, so you don't need to `npm install` multiple packages for a good stack
- I want it to be the best for other people, not just me, and won't stop till I'm satisfied.
